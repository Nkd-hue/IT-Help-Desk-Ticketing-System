# IT-Help-Desk-Ticketing-System

## Business Scenario

A 50-employee company needs an IT support system to:
- Route tickets to the right team automatically
- Track response times with SLAs
- Give managers visibility into ticket volume

---

## What I Built

**Support Teams**
- Tier 1 Support — Password resets, basic issues
- Tier 2 Support — Complex technical problems
- Network Team — Connectivity issues
- Security Team — Security incidents

**Ticket Categories**
- Hardware Issues
- Software Issues
- Network/Connectivity
- Password Reset
- New Employee Onboarding

**Auto-Routing Rules**
- Password Reset → Tier 1
- Hardware → Tier 1
- Software → Tier 2
- Network → Network Team

**SLAs**
- Critical: 2 hours
- High: 4 hours
- Medium: 8 hours
- Low: 24 hours

**Dashboard**
- Charts showing tickets by priority and category
